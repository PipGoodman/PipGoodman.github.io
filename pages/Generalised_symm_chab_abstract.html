  Answering a question of Zureick-Brown, we determine the cubic points on the modular curves $X_0(N)$ for $N \in \{53,57,61,65,67,73\}$ as well as the quartic points on $X_0(65)$. To do so, we develop a &#34;partially relative&#34; symmetric Chabauty method. Our results generalise current symmetric Chabauty theorems, and improve upon them by lowering the involved prime bound. For our curves a number of novelties occur. We prove a &#34;higher order&#34; Chabauty theorem to deal with these cases. Finally, to study the isolated quartic points on $X_0(65)$, we rigorously compute the full rational Mordell--Weil group of its Jacobian.
