  Let $\zeta_3$ be a primitive third root of unity, $K=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_3)$ and $\pi = \zeta_3-1$. Let $J$ be the Jacobian of the smooth projective curve determined by
  \[y^3 = x^{18} + \pi x^{17} + 7\pi^{15}x^3 + 14\pi^{16}x^2 + 406\pi^{15}.\]
  Then for $\ell$ prime, $\mathrm{Gal}(K(J[\ell])/K)$ is as large as it can be given the constraints imposed upon it by the endomorphisms of $J$, except possibly for $\ell = 2,3,5,7,13,17,29, 199, 5737, 160621, 7358065233619, 666738627970882050013,
572750882061546018557057917$ and $28397976581546156385381781597$.
