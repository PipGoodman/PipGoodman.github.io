  Let $r>2$ and $\ell$ be primes. In this paper we study the mod $\ell$ Galois representations attached to curves of the form $y^r = f(x)$ where $f$ is monic and has coefficients belonging to the $r$-th cyclotomic field.
  We provide conditions on the coefficients (and degree) of $f$ which allow one to verify the mod $\ell$ image is large outside of a (typically small) finite explicit set of primes. We allow all values of $r$ for which the $r$-th cyclotomic field has odd class number. This appears to be the first explicit result for abelian varieties of dimension greater than two and not of ${\rm GL}_2$-type which allows the ground field to have unramified extensions.
  <br> In proving the large image result we give a classification of the maximal subgroups containing transvections of certain classical groups and describe (in many cases) the images of inertia groups.
  The exact mod $\ell$ image is governed by the "endomorphism character", a certain algebraic Hecke character which generalises the CM character. When $r=3$, we depict the image in its entirety. To the author's knowledge, this is the first accurate description in the literature.
  <br> Finally, we give several examples with genus ranging from 10 to 36. Applications to the Inverse Galois Problem are also included.
